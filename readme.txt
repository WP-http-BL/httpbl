== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does http:BL WordPress Plugin work with WordPress MU? =

Yes, it does. If you don't want to give your bloggers an access to the plugin's configuration page, you have to modify the source code slightly. Find a line containing `plugins.php` and change it to `wpmu-admin.php`. It should work fine.

For even better compatibility with WPMU take a look at [zice.ro blog](http://zice.ro/blog/2007/05/07/modified-honeypot-plugin/).

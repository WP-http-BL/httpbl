== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does http:BL WordPress Plugin work with WordPress MU? =

Yes, it does. If you don't want to give your bloggers an access to the
plugin's configuration page, you have to modify the source code slightly. Find
a line containing `plugins.php` and change it to `wpmu-admin.php`. It should
work fine. If it does not, do not hesitate to inform me about it or provide
your own patch.

= Is there an easy way to contact the developer of this plugin? =

Of course there is. Visit [author's website](http://stepien.cc/~jan) in order
